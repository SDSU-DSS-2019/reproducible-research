# Syllabus


## Description



- This course provides a survey of regression techniques for outcomes common in public health data including continuous, binary, count and survival data.  
- Emphasis is on developing a conceptual understanding of the application of these techniques to solving problems, rather than to the numerical details. 
- Extensive use of the computer will be made for analysis of datasets.

## Description

- This course is designed for graduate and advanced undergraduate students who will be analyzing data with scientific colleagues and who want to develop a practical hands-on toolkit and gain experience in distilling complex statistical information into formats understandable to colleagues. 
- This course will feature R programming elements. To make the most of R students will be expected to use \href{https://www.rstudio.com/}{RStudio}. 

##  Recommended Textbooks

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis", warning=FALSE} 
bib["regression"]
``` 

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis", warning=FALSE}  
bib["sheather"]
```


## Course Objectives

1. Recognize when data should be analyzed by regression
2. Plan an appropriate analysis
3. Bring in, Clean and Analyze data with R. 
4. Coherently summarize results. 


## Overall Course Expectations

Students in this course will be expected to do the following:

1. Attend all lectures and actively participate in discussion. 

2. Read all assigned material *prior* to coming to class and actively participate in class discussions. 

3. Complete and turn in all assignments on time. Solutions to homework must be clearly written with appropriate tables and figures included. 

4. Demonstrate an understanding on material on examinations. 

5. Respect each other, each others questions and each others discussion. 


## Evaluation

Students will be evaluated based on:


-------------------------------------------------
Grade Category          Percentage
---------------------- ---------------------------------
Participation           10\%

Homework                20\%

Exam 1 (03/13/2017)     20\%

Exam 2 (05/17/2017)     20\%

Final Project           30\%
--------------------------------------------------


## Participation

- This course will move very fast and it is crucial to success in the course that students attend and participate. 
- Many classes will have polls or quizzes that will not be graded for having the most correct or best answer but for participating. 
- Unexcused absences will result in a loss of percentage points. 


## Homework

- Weekly assignments will be given out to students. 
- Assignments will require data handling, data cleaning and interpretation of the results.  
- It is expected that all assignments are completed on time. No late assignments will be accepted. 
- Students will also be graded on the conciseness and quality of work. 
- Turning in many pages of just computer code and output will affect the grade in a negative fashion.


## Exam 1 (March 13, 2017)

- An in class exam will be given. Students will be expected to interpret and analyze regression models. 
- Students will also be expected to understand conceptual ideas. 

## Exam  2 (May 17, 2017 at 2:00pm)

- An in class exam will be given. Students will be expected to interpret and analyze regression models. 
- Students will also be expected to understand conceptual ideas. 

## Final Project

The individual part of the project will require:

1. Asking a relevant public Health question. 
2. Identify available data to answer this question. 
3. Model the question with appropriate statistical models. 
4. Write up a report with appropriate tables, graphs and results. 


## Final Project Continued
The Group part of the project will require

1. Constructive Criticism of Group members Projects based on Course Content. 
2. In depth review of group members work. 

## Semester Hours

Over the course of the semester students will spend at least the amounts of time shown below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l c }
Task & Hours Spent on Task \\ \hline\hline
Class Time       &      40\\

Homework/Class Preparation         &       90\\



Exams/Prep  & 25\\

Final Project & 25 \\\hline


Total & 180\\

##Diversity Statement

- This course is designed to support an inclusive learning environment where diverse perspectives are recognized, respected and seen as a source of strength. 
- It is our intent to provide materials and activities that are respectful of various levels of diversity: mathematical background, previous computing skills, gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture.  

# R and R Studio


## RStudio Server

- All students will have access to  [Rstudio Server](rstudio.sullivanstatistics.com) 
- This server will make it easy for these reasons
    - All required packages are loaded.
    - You can access R through a webbrowser and do not need it on your computer.
    - If your analysis takes a long time you can close the browser and come back later. 
    
## What is RStudio?

- RStudio is a graphical user interface to R. 
- It allows for R to look similar to Stata or SAS.

## Why would we use RStudio?

- Allows for easier use of R.
- Allows for simple access to loading and viewing data. 
- Allows for simple viewing of help and graphics. 
- Allows for you to include R code, graphics and typing into a document that you can export to word, html or pdf.

## RMarkdown

- In this class you will be expected to do things in R and will be using RMarkdown to incorporate your code and results into a document. 
- RMarkdown is a language that can take R code, Graphics, Text and export this as a word, html or pdf document. 


## Getting started with RMarkdown

- In the server from here on out.
